A holiday booking site to display attractions on a map based on the country the user searches for.

The project has a couple of pages,
a homepage listing the most popular destinations and a link to the map,
a page with Google Maps and a table below that gets the details of all the hotel markers that a user has searched for in a city 
and a page where the user can fill out a contact form with booking details that are then sent to me by email.

## Project Bugs and Solutions:



## Remaining bugs: 



## Deployment:

Once a GIthub account was created, I opened a new repository by clicking the green button "new". To create this project, I used the Code Institute's student [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

Click on the green "gitpod" button where one is redirected to to [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

Gitpod, a cloud-based version control software or IDE was used to write all code for this project.

It was then pushed or saved in the terminal to Github where it is stored in a [repository](https://github.com/SeanD17/Milestone-Project-2)

Under "Settings", I scrolled down to Github Pages and selected "Master Branch" under source, to where the page was automated.

Once this was selected, the project was pushed to Github pages and the URL is then displayed

To access the code, it can be run locally by either selecting "clone" which provides an URL one can use on their local machine or "download" which is where one can download the zip file on to their machine.

This website is hosted through GitHub Pages and any changes made to the website are shown almost immediately after pushing to GitHub.

For the website to work an index html had to be created before GitHub Pages can display the website.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/SeanD17/Milestone-Project-2.git` into your terminal. 

To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
